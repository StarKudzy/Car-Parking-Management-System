Project Overview:
The Car Park Management System (CPMS) is a desktop application built using JavaFX and MySQL.It allows staff to register vehicles, assign parking slots, and manage check-in/check-out, while administrators can search records and generate reports (daily, weekly, yearly).
The system is designed as a free parking system, focusing on simplicity, reliability, and clean database relationships.
The system replaces manual parking records with an automated solution that ensures accurate tracking of vehicles, parking slots and usage statistics in real time.
The parking system is intentionally designed as a frees parking system in order to focus on core operational logic such as vehicle registration, slot allocation , reporting and as well quick retrival of specific vehicle information from the system. The system supports two distinct user roles : staff and Admin, each with separate responsibilities. Staff members are responsible for day to day parking operations including vehicle check-in, parkkng slot allocation, record updates and vehicle check-out.On the other hand, Administrators focus on monitoring and analysis, with access to vehicle searches, parking status overviews and statistical reports.
